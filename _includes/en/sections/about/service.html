    <p class="f4 f3-ns fw4 brand lh-copy mb4 mb5-ns">Angelr is a next-generation corporate finance firm for startups and tech companies. We help startups and innovators with fundraising from start to finish; including advising startups when deciding valuation and creating IM, connecting with investors and closing the deal. Our members consist of {{ site.data.data.num_investors }}+ of Sweden’s top private and institutional investors.</p>

    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">​​​​​​​One of the greatest challenges today's startups and innovators face is raising capital. It’s a time demanding and slow rolling process that few look forward to. Few innovators realize the challenges they are facing. To meet the right investor in the right moment, to get that right angle of the project and the work around creating the actual company.</p>
    
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">We believe that the next large innovations - and thus value growth - will come from small innovative fast-growing companies. With new technologies and mindset, a small team of dedicated entrepreneurs can change an industry within years. However, the capital market in Europe for startups hasn’t caught up and is still very unstructured. Great companies and founders can still have a hard time finding investors and even for the ones that succeed it can be a very time-demanding and tiring process. We think founders should focus on innovating and growing their business and let a trusted partner help with financing.</p>
    
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">Raising capital can be time-demanding and a round normally takes at least 3 months – if not longer – to complete. No more sending cold emails to random investors. With Angelr you get access to our network of investors and a team working full time to close your round. Angelr has a large network of private and institutional investors. We have met most of our investor members in person and know their exact preferences and expertise. Thus, we always aim to connect startups with investors who can bring value beside the investment.</p>
