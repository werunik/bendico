    <h4>Risks</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
        <i>Otherwise when explicitly stated, definitions used in the Terms of Service shall apply equally to this segment about Risk.</i>
    </p>

    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    Every Investor User should be aware that investments made in Start-ups featured on the Angelr Platform, like most investments, involve a high degree of risk. There is no assurance that a Start-up’s objectives will be achieved or that an Investor User will achieve return on the investment.
    </p>

    <h4>Risks of investing in Start-ups</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    Investment in Start-ups involves a high degree of risk. The proposed return of the Start-up may never be realized. Loss of an Investor User’s entire investment is always a possibility. Additionally, the time of the potential return is uncertain. Below are some of the common risks associated with investing in Start-ups.
    </p>
    <h4>The risks of investing in technologies</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    The value of the investment in a Start-up may be susceptible to changes in the technology of the Start-up. Some of the risks include that the technology may become obsolete, scarcity of future employees with adequate training, the problems such as lawsuits related to patents and intellectual property, and exposure to government regulation.
    </p>
    <h4>Changing economic conditions</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    The success of any investment is to some degrees determined by general economic conditions. The availability of external credit markets, equity markets and other economic systems which an individual Start-up may depend upon may have a negative impact on a Start-up’s operations and profitability. The stability of economic conditions may be affected by unpredictable events such as terrorism and acts of war. Changing economic conditions could potentially, and frequently do, adversely impact the valuation of portfolio holdings.
    </p>
    <h4>Future and past performance</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    The past performance of a Start-up or its management is not predictive of a Start-up’s future results. There can be no assurance that targeted results will be achieved.
    Difficulty of valuing Start-up investments
    It is difficult to determine objective values for any Start-up. In addition to determine the magnitude of risk or the likelihood that a Start-up will be a success, it is hard to value an Investor User’s investment due to the lack of a readily available market for a Start-up’s securities.
    </p>
    <h4>Minority investments</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    If the Investor User invests a minority stake in a Start-up, which is most often the case, such minority stake will have neither the control characteristics of majority stakes nor the valuation premiums accorded majority or controlling stakes.
    </p>
    <h4>Lack of information for monitoring and valuing Start-ups</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    The Investor User may not be able to obtain all the information it would want regarding a particular Start-up, on a timely basis or at all. As a result, an Investor User may not have accurate information about a Start-up’s current value.
    </p>
    <h4>No assurance of additional capital for Start-ups</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    After an Investor User has invested in a Start-up, continued development and marketing of the Start-up’s products or services, or other needs, may require that it obtain additional financing. Such additional financing may not be available on favourable terms, or at all.
    </p>
    <h4>Absence of liquidity and public markets</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    Since an Investor User’s investments generally are private, illiquid holdings, there will be no public markets for the securities.
    </p>
    <h4>Tax risks</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    There are some tax risks associated with investing in Start-ups and you should consult your tax advisor about the consequences of purchasing equity securities of a Start-up.
    </p>
    <h4>Confidential information</h4>
    <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy">
    Certain information regarding the Start-up may be highly confidential. Competitors may benefit from such information if it is ever made public and that could result in adverse economic consequences for the Investor User.
